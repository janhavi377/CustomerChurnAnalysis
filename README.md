# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis – EDA Project

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the key factors contributing to customer churn in a telecom company. Using a dataset of customer attributes, we explore trends and correlations to uncover insights that can help reduce churn.

- Account info: `Contract`, `PaperlessBilling`, `PaymentMethod`, `tenure`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`
- Target: `Churn`

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- `pandas` & `numpy` – data handling
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – visualization

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Churn distribution & correlation heatmap
- Visual insights on contract type, monthly charges, internet services, and tenure
